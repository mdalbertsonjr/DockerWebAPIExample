Problem:
Ran into a problem where the docker pull command timedout.

Solution:
Restarted docker for windows.

Problem:
The ports I used in my docker-compose seem to not get deallocated:

ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.

Solution:
Tried to docker-compose down and noticed that there was still a container bound to 80.
Did a docker rm -f <name of container> and that seems to have deleted it.

Doing docker-compose commands in powershell alongside visual studio seems to confuse things.
